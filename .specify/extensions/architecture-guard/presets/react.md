# Architecture Guard — React (Standalone) Architecture Adapter

## Init Interview

Ask these questions sequentially after the standalone React preset is selected. Skip questions already resolved by existing constitution context.

### Application Architecture

Ask:

```text
How should the React application be organized?

- Feature-oriented modules
- Pages, components, hooks, and services
- Container and presentational components
- Domain-oriented frontend modules
- Hybrid based on complexity
```

### Logic and Dependency Boundaries

Ask:

```text
How should components access application logic and dependencies?

- Custom hooks and explicit imports
- Context providers
- Factory functions with explicit parameters
- A project-adopted DI library
- No enforced convention
```

React has no built-in DI container. Prefer composition, hooks, context, or explicit parameters unless the project already demonstrates a container need.

### State Ownership

Ask:

```text
Which state belongs locally, in Context, in a client store, or in server-state tooling?
```

### API and Contract Infrastructure

Ask:

```text
How should API clients, runtime validation, caching, retries, authentication refresh, and error translation be handled?
```

### Routing and Authorization

Ask:

```text
Which router owns navigation, and how should route visibility differ from server-enforced authorization?
```


### Code Style & Tooling

Ask:

```text
Which framework-specific lint/style conventions apply to this project, if any?

Examples:
- ESLint strictness, Prettier formatting
- Forbidden hooks patterns
```

## Senior Engineering Lens

Apply the framework mapping with senior judgment:

- Treat directory names, layer counts, file length, and pattern names as signals, not proof. Confirm a concrete correctness, security, ownership, change-coupling, or operability cost before reporting a violation.
- Start from the Constitution and patterns already working in the repository. Do not introduce a layer, library, DTO, store, repository, or service solely because this preset lists it.
- Distinguish correctness requirements from maintainability advice. Security, trust-boundary validation, data integrity, and contract breaches may block; preference-level structure remains advisory.
- For each finding, teach the reasoning: show evidence, name the violated boundary or principle, explain the likely failure mode, propose the smallest correction, and state how to verify it.
- Evaluate tradeoffs that matter for the change, such as transaction scope, retries and idempotency, latency, state ownership, failure isolation, concurrency, and migration risk. Do not manufacture irrelevant categories.
- Apply the shared Ponytail Core decision ladder and safety floor. Prefer native framework features and installed dependencies before proposing custom infrastructure.

Use the core architecture review rules first. This adapter refines generic architecture concepts with **React (Standalone/Vite/CRA)** conventions. It specifically focuses on the separation of UI (Components) and Logic (Hooks/Services), preventing the "Fat Component" anti-pattern and enforcing clean state management.

## Boundary Mapping

When reviewing a React project, map generic architecture boundaries to React primitives:

### Entry Boundary

| Generic Concept | React Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Entry point for HTTP routing | Pages (in `src/pages/` or `src/routes/`) |
| Entry point for User Events | Event Handlers in components |
| Global Layout / Context | Layout Components or Context Providers |
| Navigation filtering | Route Guards / Protected Route components |

### Validation Boundary

| Generic Concept | React Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Form validation | Zod / Yup / Valibot schemas |
| Input transformation | React Hook Form `transform` or manual state mapping |

### Contract Boundary

| Generic Concept | React Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Component contracts | TypeScript Interfaces (`Props`) |
| API contracts | DTO Interfaces for Request/Response |
| Shared state shapes | Store Interfaces (Zustand, Redux, or Context) |

### Application Boundary

| Generic Concept | React Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Shared logic coordination | Custom Hooks (`src/hooks/`) |
| Use case orchestration | Logic-heavy Hooks or Service classes |
| Global state coordination | Store Actions (Zustand) or Thunks (Redux) |

### Domain Boundary

| Generic Concept | React Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Business rules and decisions | Pure JS/TS Functions in `src/domain/` or `src/utils/` |
| Domain entities | TypeScript Types or Classes |

### Data Boundary

| Generic Concept | React Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Persistence abstraction | API Clients (`src/api/` or `src/services/`) |
| Data fetching layer | React Query (TanStack Query) hooks or SWR |
| Persistence management | LocalStorage / IndexedDB wrappers |

### Presentation Boundary

| Generic Concept | React Equivalent |
| --- | --- |
| Pure UI Components | Presentational / Dumb Components (`src/components/ui/`) |
| Composed UI | Container Components or Page Components |
| Global UI State | Theme Providers, Toast Providers |

---

## React-Specific Detection Rules

### Fat Component (Logic Leakage)

Detect when a component:
- Owns business decisions, complex transformations, or multi-step workflows that change for reasons unrelated to rendering.
- Directly uses `fetch` or `axios` inside a `useEffect` (this should be in a Service or Data hook).
- Manually manages complex state that should be in a **Custom Hook** or a **Store**.

**Acceptable in components:**
- UI-only state (`isOpen`, `isHovered`).
- Mapping props to JSX.
- Calling a single custom hook or dispatching a store action.

### The "Smart vs. Dumb" Boundary

Detect when:
- Reusable UI components (`src/components/ui/`) import from the API layer or the Global Store (they should be pure and driven by props).
- Components directly access `localStorage` or `sessionStorage` instead of using an abstraction.

### Prop Drilling vs. Context

Detect when:
- A value is repeatedly threaded through unrelated components, creating measurable change coupling or unclear ownership.
- **Recommendation**: First consider composition or colocating state. Use an existing Context or store only when the value is genuinely shared and its update behavior fits that mechanism.

### Missing Data Fetching Abstraction [Focus: api]

Detect when:
- Raw `fetch` or `axios` calls are written inside component bodies.
- API endpoints are hardcoded in components instead of being in a centralized `api/` or `constants/` file.

## Common React Anti-Patterns to Flag

### 1. Fat Component (Mixed Concerns)

```tsx
// ❌ Component handles UI and API logic
export function UserProfile({ id }) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(`/api/users/${id}`)
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(data => {
        // complex transformation logic here...
        setUser(data);
      });
  }, [id]);

  if (!user) return <Spinner />;
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
```

```tsx
// ✅ UI Component delegates to Hook
import { useUser } from "@/hooks/useUser";

export function UserProfile({ id }) {
  const { user, isLoading } = useUser(id); // Logic is here

  if (isLoading) return <Spinner />;
  return <div>{user.name}</div>;
}
```

### 2. Leaky UI Components

```tsx
// ❌ Button depends on Global Auth Store
import { useAuthStore } from "@/store/auth";

export function LogoutButton() {
  const logout = useAuthStore(s => s.logout);
  return <button onClick={logout}>Logout</button>;
}
```

## Output Format

When this adapter is active, the architecture review should include a **React Conventions** section:

```text
React Conventions:
- Logic Separation: [Hooks-based / Component-heavy / Mixed]
- Component Purity: [Strict / Leaky UI / Fat Containers]
- State Management: [Store-driven / Context / Prop-Drilling]
- Data Fetching: [Abstracted / Raw-Fetch / Mixed]
```

---

## Guardrails

- Do not flag small (1–3 lines) logic in components as violations.
- Do not require a global store for small projects.
- The Constitution is the final authority. This adapter provides React context, not overrides.
