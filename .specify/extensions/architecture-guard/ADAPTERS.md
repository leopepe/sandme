# Architecture Guard Adapters

Adapters are the bridge between Architecture Guard's tool-agnostic governance commands and the specific SDD tool or workflow you use.

## How It Works

```
Orchestration command (e.g., init.md)
         │
         ▼
  adapters/detect.md  ─── detects active SDD tool
         │
         ▼
  adapters/{tool}.md  ─── provides path map + command map + gaps
         │
         ▼
Tool-specific output (constitution, config.yaml, etc.)
```

## Built-in Adapters

| SDD Tool or Workflow | Adapter File | Detection Marker |
|---|---|---|
| SpecKit | `adapters/spec-kit.md` | `.specify/` directory |
| OpenSpec | `adapters/openspec.md` | `openspec/config.yaml` |
| Generic workflow | `adapters/generic.md` | Installer selection or no detected SDD tool |

## Adapter Contract

Each adapter file must define these sections and every canonical key referenced by orchestration. Both built-in adapters expose the same keys; unsupported operations state concrete inline or skip behavior rather than omitting a key.

### Path Map
A table mapping canonical names to concrete file paths:

```markdown
## Path Map

| Canonical Name | Path |
|---|---|
| constitution | `path/to/constitution.md` |
| spec | `path/to/specs/{name}/spec.md` |
| plan | `path/to/plan.md` |
| ponytail-template | `.architecture-guard/templates/ponytail_core.md` |
```

### Command Map
A table mapping governance actions to SDD-tool-native invocations:

```markdown
## Command Map

| Canonical Key | SDD Tool Invocation or Fallback |
|---|---|
| create-spec | `commandspec`, or explicit inline creation when unsupported |
| analyze | `validate --strict`, plus inline coverage analysis when needed |
```

### Gap Fill Actions
List features the SDD tool lacks and how to fill them:

```markdown
## Gap Fill Actions

1. **Missing feature** — The SDD tool does not provide X.
   - Fill: Do Y inline.
```

### Hook Events
When governance checks should run in relation to the SDD tool's lifecycle.

## Creating a New Adapter

1. Copy `adapters/generic.md` as a starting template.
2. Replace the Path Map with your tool's artifact conventions.
3. Replace the Command Map with your tool's CLI commands or agent commands.
4. Declare any gaps your tool has.
5. Place the file at `adapters/{tool-name}.md`.
6. Update `adapters/detect.md` detection chain to recognize your tool's marker.

Adapter files are self-contained markdown. No code changes needed.

Installed shared resources always resolve under `.architecture-guard/{templates,presets,hygiene-rules,sonar-rules,scripts}`. SDD tool directories hold SDD artifacts only. Before a command body runs, detection resolves every adapter token; missing keys stop with `AdapterMissingKey: <kind>:<key>` and unresolved substitutions stop with `AdapterUnresolvedToken: <token>`.
