# Governed Tasks Command

## Ponytail Core Contract

Before continuing, you **MUST** read and apply `.specify/extensions/architecture-guard/templates/ponytail_core.md` (or `templates/ponytail_core.md` in the extension source checkout) as the authoritative shared contract. Phase instructions may narrow but not weaken its safety or verification floor.

## Budgeted Context Contract

Read and apply `.specify/extensions/architecture-guard/templates/budgeted_context.md` (or `templates/budgeted_context.md` in the extension source checkout). The active feature's specification and design artifacts (e.g., `spec.md`, `design.md`, `plan.md`), and applicable constitutions are mandatory and authoritative. Flash-Mem and `system_context.md` may supplement but never replace them.

You are orchestrating the `ag-governed-tasks` workflow for `architecture-guard`.

This command coordinates multiple extensions to ensure the task list respects architectural, historical, and security constraints before implementation begins.

## Goal

Provide a single command that ensures:
1. Implementation tasks are historical-context aware when Flash-Mem is available.
2. A task list is generated or validated (`/speckit.tasks`).
3. Security requirements are represented in tasks (Security Review).
4. Architecture refactors or migrations are represented in tasks (Architecture Guard).
5. The tasks are formally analyzed for gaps and severities (`/speckit.analyze`).
6. An automatic loop is offered to clarify and revise tasks if gaps are found.

## Orchestration Flow

### Step 1 — Detect Optional Integrations

Check for the availability of:
- `flash-mem` MCP server
- `security-review` (or compatibility alias `spec-kit-security-review`) extension

**Detection Logic**:
1. Detect `flash-mem` as an MCP-backed memory service in the current environment. Do not treat it as a Spec Kit extension or look for it in `.specify/extensions.yml`.
2. Read `.specify/extensions.yml` and check the `installed` list for `security-review` (or compatibility alias `spec-kit-security-review`). Fall back to checking for the extension directory in `.specify/extensions/` only if the YAML is missing or the list is empty.
3. If either capability is missing, degrade gracefully by skipping only its respective steps.

### Step 2 — Flash-Mem MCP Context Retrieval (Optional)

When Flash-Mem is available, use it first to gather the most relevant architectural context before task generation. Prefer summary-first context and only expand into repository files when needed.

If Flash-Mem is unavailable or the context is insufficient, continue with the repository artifacts and constitution files available in the workspace.

**[OPTIONAL SUB-AGENT DELEGATION]**
* **Capability Gate:** First confirm that `/speckit.subagent.synthesize` is registered and callable. If it is unavailable, execute inline regardless of size and report the degraded path.
* **Trigger Condition:** When the capability is available, you **MUST** delegate memory retrieval and synthesis if:
  - The Flash-Mem index contains $\ge 20$ memory documents.
  - OR the project repository contains $\ge 15$ active ADRs/docs.
  - Otherwise, you **MUST** execute inline.
* **Execution Syntax:** Call the memory synthesis sub-agent via:
  `/speckit.subagent.synthesize --context=tasks-generation`
* **Strict Handoff Template:** Format the sub-agent prompt exactly like this:
  ```yaml
  Task: Retrieve and synthesize relevant architecture constraints and ADRs.
  Focus: Rules and conventions affecting implementation tasks.
  Expected Output: Synthesized markdown summary of constraints to integrate directly into tasks.md.
  ```

### Step 3 — Orchestrate Spec Kit Tasks

You must orchestrate the `/speckit.tasks` workflow directly.

**CRITICAL INSTRUCTION**: You must NOT just advise the user or stop here. You must actually generate the tasks:
1. **Apply Ponytail Pragmatism**: Instruct the agent to act as a "lazy senior developer." Break down the work into the absolute minimal tasks needed. Refuse to add boilerplate, unnecessary abstractions, or "future-proofing" tasks.
   - If the same logic appears in multiple modules, create a single extraction task instead of parallel copy-paste tasks.
2. **Execute Tasks**: Run `/speckit.tasks` to generate and save `specs/<feature>/tasks.md`.

   **If `/speckit.tasks` is not available as a registered command** (i.e., the AI agent does not recognize it as a slash command), fall back to inline task generation:
   - Read the technical design document (e.g., `specs/<feature>/plan.md` or `openspec/.../design.md`) (and `spec.md` if present).
   - Read all applicable constitution files (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/architecture_constitution.md`, `.specify/memory/security_constitution.md`).
   - Use Flash-Mem context and `specs/<feature>/security-constraints.md` if available.
   - Generate `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` directly, breaking down the plan into implementation-ready tasks with checkbox format. Enforce Ponytail minimalism.
   - Note in the Governance Summary that `/speckit.tasks` was unavailable and task generation was performed inline.

2. The generated tasks MUST use the Project Constitution documents and feature context. Use Flash-Mem first when available. If retrieval is unavailable or insufficient, read constitution files and feature security constraints directly with file-reading tools. Do not rely solely on workspace search or semantic indexes because these files are often in `.gitignore`.
3. Prefer compact, feature-scoped task generation over broad restatements of the full memory set.

### Step 4 — Security Review on Tasks

IF `security-review` (or compatibility alias `spec-kit-security-review`) is available:
1. **Execute Review**: Run `/speckit.security-review.tasks` to review the task list.
2. Check for missing tasks related to:
    - Validation, authorization, and trust boundaries.
    - Secure integration and audit/logging.
3. Update `specs/<feature>/security-constraints.md` with any new findings.

### Step 5 — Architecture Refactor Generation

Run:
```text
/ag-refactor-generator
```

It MUST convert architecture findings into:
- Explicit implementation, migration, or refactor tasks.
- Boundary-level or contract-level corrections.
- **Prefer module-level tasks** over broad system rewrites.

### Step 6 — Orchestrate Spec Kit Analysis

You must orchestrate the `/speckit.analyze` workflow directly to serve as the formal analyst.

1. **Execute Analyze**: Run `/speckit.analyze` on the complete task list and architecture refactors.
2. **Architecture Validation**: Detect any gaps, missing requirements, or high-severity execution risks present in the implementation plan or task list.

### Step 7 — Proactive Durable Memory Preservation

If the task generation or security review identified new architectural lessons or reusable patterns:
1. **Proactive Execution**: You **MUST automatically execute** the durable-memory capture flow as the final part of this turn. Do not just recommend it; run the command.
2. **Standard**: Do not silently write memory outside the capture flow; let the formal capture flow propose entries and handle user approval.

### Step 8 — Task Governance Summary

Produce a final `Governed Tasks Summary` for the user.

### Step 9 — Automatic Analyst Loop

If the analyst (`/speckit.analyze`) finds any gaps, missing steps, or high severity issues in Step 6:
1. **Pause and Ask**: Conclude your response by asking the user:
   > *"The analyst found [number] gaps/severities in the tasks. Would you like me to automatically clarify and revise the tasks to address these findings?"*
2. **Execute if Approved**: If the user answers "yes" (or equivalent) in their next message, you must:
   - Automatically rewrite `specs/<feature>/tasks.md` to resolve the detected gaps.
   - Present the clean result.

## Graceful Degradation

**Without Flash-Mem MCP**:
- Skip Step 2 (Flash-Mem MCP Context Retrieval)
- Continue to `/speckit.tasks` directly
- Assume no historical task constraints beyond Constitution

**Without Security Review**:
- Skip Step 4 (Security Review on Tasks)
- Continue to refactor-generator directly
- Flag missing security task validation in summary

**If No Architecture Violations**:
- Report "Architecture refactor tasks: None"
- Task list is complete

**Minimal Viable Workflow** (only Architecture Guard + Spec Kit):
- Detect optional integrations
- Generate tasks via core Spec Kit
- Validate against Constitution + architecture boundaries
- Produce summary

## Output Structure

The command MUST return:

```markdown
# Governed Tasks Summary

## Memory Context
- **Status**: [Synthesized / Skipped / Missing]
- **Relevant Decisions**: [List of historical constraints affecting these tasks]

## Security Task Review
- **Missing Security Tasks**: [List of missing auth/val/audit tasks]
- **Constraints**: [Key security boundaries to respect]

## Architecture Task Review
- **Refactor Tasks**: [Tasks generated by refactor-generator]
- **Migration Tasks**: [Specific steps for architectural migration]
- **Architecture Risks**: [Drift or conflicts detected in the task list]

## Recommended Next Step
- [e.g., Continue to /ag-governed-implement]
- [e.g., Revise tasks to address missing security items]
- [e.g., Update architecture constitution if standard is outdated]
- **Durable Memory Preservation**: (Proactively triggered) Review the proposed memory entries below.
```

## Output Rules

- **Separation**: Clearly separate implementation tasks, security tasks, and architecture refactor tasks.
- **Precision**: Do NOT merge findings into vague task items.
- **Non-Blocking**: Findings are advisory by default.
